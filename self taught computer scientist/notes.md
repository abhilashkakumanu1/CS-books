Algorithm => Definite, Effective, Finite, Correct
Computer scientists compare algorithms by looking at the number of steps they require

## Searching Algorithms

Linear search => `in` keyword in python
Binary search => `bisect.bisect_left` function. `bisect` is a built-in module which is used for insert data into a ordered list. It uses bisection algorithms to maintain the order, hence the name. `bisect.insort_left` can be used to do in-order insert.
